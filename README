sharebox is a distributed FUSE filesystem for sharing files across several
machines. It supports disconnected operations: you can go offline and
modify a file: the modifications will be propagated when you'll be back.
If several hosts modify the same file, an interactive conflict handler is
spawned on the hosts (but only one host needs to resolve the conflict). Of
course, builtin automatic versionning is provided, with a configurable
number of versions. It is also space-efficient: files appear as present on
the system but are actually dowloaded from peers ondemand. You can also
control where your data lives with a set of commands.

Features:
- fully distributed
- offline operations
- copy on write
- builtin versionning
- interactive conflicts handling

An important detail: sharebox is nothing more than a very simple
filesystem layer around the wonderful git-annex, which actually does all
the work. You can thank its creator for being a genius.

== Howto ==

Here is the output of sharebox --help:

sharebox <mountpoint> [-o <option>]

Options:
    -o gitdir=<path>            mandatory: path to the git directory to
                                actually store the files in.
    -o sync=<seconds>           interval to wait between syncronisations.
                                Any number <=0 means "never" (default 0).
    -o numversions=<number>     number of different versions of the same
                                file to keep. Any number <=0 means "keep
                                everything" (default 0).
    -o getall                   when there are modifications on a remote,
                                download the content of files.
    -o foreground               debug mode.

Adding a mirror:

Go to the local git directory and add the remote git directory as a mirror
to pull from:

git remote add <name> <url>

== State of the project ==

sharebox is at the very early stage. Even the author still does not use it
as a working solution.

What is implemented right now:
- The default state for files is to be commited to git-annex: their
  content is not versionned, only links to their content.
- They are presented by the file system as regular files, resolved by
  reading the links. If they are not present on the system, they are seen
  as empty files.
- When a file not present on the system is accessed (with the open()
  system call) 'git annex get' is used to get the content of the file (If
  it is not possible to get the file, there is an access error).
- Copy on write is used: When you open a file, you open the read-only file
  linked by git-annex (even if you tried to open it with write access). If
  you do not modify the file, nothing happens, but if you do, the file is
  'git annex unlock'-ed (It then occupies twice the necessary space) and
  the result is commited to git when the file is closed.

What is implemented, but does not work very well:
- There is a mount option for specifying a synchronisation interval. This
  is not working well yet.

What is not implemented:
- Documentation.
- Conflicts are not handled yet.
- The number of copies kept for the same file is not setable yet, but it
  should become a mount option.
- A good test suite.
