sharebox is a distributed FUSE filesystem for sharing files across several
machines. It supports disconnected operations: you can go offline and
modify a file: the modifications will be propagated when you'll be back.
If several hosts modify the same file, an interactive conflict handler is
spawned on the hosts (but only one host needs to resolve the conflict). Of
course, builtin automatic versionning is provided, with a configurable
number of versions. It is also space-efficient: files appear as present on
the system but are actually dowloaded from peers ondemand. You can also
control where your data lives with a set of commands.

Features:
- fully distributed
- offline operations
- copy on write
- builtin versionning
- interactive conflicts handling

An important detail: sharebox is nothing more than a very simple
filesystem layer around the wonderful git-annex, which actually does all
the work. You can thank its creator for being a genius.
