sharebox is a distributed FUSE filesystem for sharing files across several
machines. It supports disconnected operations: you can go offline and
modify a file: the modifications will be propagated when you'll be back.
If several hosts modify the same file, an interactive conflict handler is
spawned on the hosts (but only one host needs to resolve the conflict). Of
course, builtin automatic versionning is provided, with a configurable
number of versions. It is also space-efficient: files appear as present on
the system but are actually dowloaded from peers ondemand. You can also
control where your data lives with a set of commands.

Features:
- fully distributed
- offline operations
- copy on write
- builtin versionning
- interactive conflicts handling

An important detail: sharebox is nothing more than a very simple
filesystem layer around the wonderful git-annex, which actually does all
the work. You can thank its creator for being a genius.

== Walkthrough ==

1) We create an empty directory where to actually put the files. Sharebox
will manage this directory for us.

mkdir -p test/local/git

2) We create a directory that will be sharebox's mountpoint

mkdir -p test/local/mnt

3) We mount test/local/git into test/local/mnt. 'sync' indicates how many
seconds the filesystem should wait between querying peers for changes.

sharebox.py test/local/mnt -o gitdir=test/local/git -o sync=10

4) Now let's set up a mirror. We go with the usual

mkdir -p test/remote/git
mkdir -p test/remote/mnt
sharebox.py test/remote/mnt -o gitdir=test/remote/git -o sync=10

5) We still need to set the git directories as remotes of each another

cd test/remote/git
git remote add local ../../local/git
cd ../../local/git
git remote add remote ../../remote/git
cd ../../..

6) It is now time for testing!

echo test > test/local/mnt/foo
sleep 11 && ls -l test/remote/mnt
touch test/remote/mnt/foo
cat test/remote/mnt/foo

7) We are done. We can unmount the two directories

fusermount -u test/local/mnt
fusermount -u test/remote/mnt

== Documentation ==

There is just this README, and the output of sharebox.py --help.

== State of the project ==

sharebox is at the very early stage. Even the author still does not use it
as a working solution.

What is implemented right now:
- The default state for files is to be commited to git-annex: their
  content is not versionned, only links to their content.
- They are presented by the file system as regular files, resolved by
  reading the links. If they are not present on the system, they are seen
  as empty files.
- When a file not present on the system is accessed (with the open()
  system call) 'git annex get' is used to get the content of the file (If
  it is not possible to get the file, there is an access error).
- Copy on write is used: When you open a file, you open the read-only file
  linked by git-annex (even if you tried to open it with write access). If
  you do not modify the file, nothing happens, but if you do, the file is
  'git annex unlock'-ed (It then occupies twice the necessary space) and
  the result is commited to git when the file is closed.

What is implemented, but does not work very well:
- There is a mount option for specifying a synchronisation interval. This
  is not working well yet.

What is not implemented:
- Documentation.
- The number of copies kept for the same file is not setable yet, but it
  should become a mount option.
- A good test suite.

== Debugging ==

To debug, mount with the foreground option:

sharebox.py test/local/mnt -o gitdir=test/local/git -o foreground
