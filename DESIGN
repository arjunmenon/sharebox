We talk here about the functional design, not the implementation design.

Sharebox is a filesystem, and every way to interact with it should be via
classical filesystem commands.

When mounted, there already exists a special file in the root that is
named ".command". This file is here for telling sharebox to do stuff
(setting properties, managing files...)

If necessary, a special file named ".properties" should be created to get
some informations about the filesystem (path to gitdir, mount options)...

Former versions of files should be accessible through a special directory
".trash". If possible, the user should be able to restore them or delete
them via regular filesystem commands.
